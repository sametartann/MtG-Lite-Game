Magic the Gathering Lite Project (June 5, 2021)

In this project, I was assigned to write a C++ program that simulates a simplified version of the Magic the Gathering (MtG) card game by Wizards of the Coast.

The guiding code for defence is also included. All the other functions are included and working properly.

In order to run this program perfectly, please follow the descriptions.

When the program asks to play a card, if you would like to, then write "yes". Otherwise, write "no".
When the program asks to enter a card name, write the correct name such as "WhiteKnight".
When the program asks the option for attacking, if you would like to, then write "yes" and select the name of the card you'll attack with. Otherwise write "no" when it asks for.

After these, the program will ask for defence, if you do not select to defend, write "no". Otherwise, write "yes" and select both the card for defence and the enemy's attacking card.

When your HP is less then or equal to '0', you will lose the game.

Good luck and have fun!
