# **Magic the Gathering Lite Project (June 5, 2021)**

## Information

In this project, designed and implemented a C++ program that simulates a simplified version of the Magic the Gathering (MtG) card game by Wizards of the Coast.

## How To Run

To run this program perfectly, please follow the descriptions.

- When the program asks you to play a card, if you would like to, then write "yes". Otherwise, write "no".
- When the program asks to enter a card name, write the correct name like "WhiteKnight".
- When the program asks the option for attack; if you would like to, write "yes" and select the name of the card you will attack with. Otherwise, write "no" when it asks for.

- After these, the program will ask for defense. If you do not select to defend, write "no". Otherwise, write "yes" and select both the card for defense and the enemy's attacking card.

- When your HP is less than or equal to '0', then you lose the game.

**Good luck and have fun!**
